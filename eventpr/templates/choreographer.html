    <h4>Find Wedding Choreographers @ Happy Wedding</h4>
    <p class="my-4">Weddings in the early days were a very serious affair with rigid rituals, <span>songs to melt hearts</span>, and emotional outbursts. They still are, but with a more relaxed atmosphere where families enjoy every ritual with music and dance. This is reflected most in the Sangeet ceremony where all the close relatives and friends give dance performances. It is the Sangeet ceremony that adds glamour and spice to the weddings.</p>

    <h4>Types of Wedding Dance Performances</h4>
    <p class="my-4"> <span>Couple Dances</span> - These are most anticipated dance performances by couples in the family-like chacha-Chachi, bhaiya- bhabhi, and bua fufa, and didi-jiju. The need to be choreographed in such a way that it brings out the shy emotions of the couple considering their comfort level while dancing.</p>
    <p class="my-4"> <span>Family dance</span> - parents, siblings, best friends - all are a part of the story and together they can weave a magical tale for the guests. They can be made to dance on specific and appropriate songs with the couple and create a story too. It is a beautiful way to expressing their love and affection for each other and for the couple.</p>
    <p class="my-4"> <span>Solo dance</span> - The most awaited dance of the evening in which the bride and the groom perform individually or as a couple or both to exhibit their happiness and love for each other.</p>
