What qualities does he/she possess? We are gonna help you with that! Go through this list of qualities that make a DJ the best DJ for weddings.</p>
    <p class="my-4"> <span>DJ Must Be a Good Listener</span> - A good wedding DJ will pay attention to your wants and needs. He recognises that this is one of the most precious days of your life and that you have put your faith in him/her to make it perfect. If the DJ doesn't understand something you want, he should ask questions until he understands exactly what you want and how to make it happen.</p>

This involves involving the wedding guests in the official announcements and ensuring he correctly pronounces the names of everyone in the bridal party.
